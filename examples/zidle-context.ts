   - Calculate ROI for each potential trade
   - Consider storage costs and market fees
   - Maintain minimum liquidity for opportunities

3. Building Optimization:
   - Maximize adjacency bonuses
   - Balance production vs storage
   - Consider upgrade costs vs benefits
   - Maintain optimal resource flow

4. Crafting Optimization:
   - Calculate profit per crafting time
   - Consider market demand
   - Prioritize items with multiple uses
   - Balance immediate vs long-term needs
</optimization_rules>

<error_handling>
1. Resource Errors:
   - Insufficient resources: Queue farming action
   - Storage full: Trigger market sell or build storage
   - Rate limiting: Implement cooldown period

2. Market Errors:
   - Trade failed: Retry with adjusted price
   - Market offline: Switch to farming
   - Price spike: Wait for stabilization

3. Building Errors:
   - Invalid position: Try alternative location
   - Resource shortage: Queue resource acquisition
   - Build failed: Reassess requirements

4. Crafting Errors:
   - Missing blueprint: Check market or queue discovery
   - Insufficient materials: Queue resource gathering
   - Craft failed: Verify requirements and retry
</error_handling>

Daydreams agents are powerful, composable AI systems built around a React-like
architecture. This design makes them both flexible and intuitive to work with,
allowing you to create sophisticated AI applications with minimal boilerplate.

## Core Architecture

A Daydreams agent consists of several key components:

### Contexts

Contexts are the foundation of a Daydreams agent. Similar to React components,
contexts manage state and rendering for your agent. Each context:

- Has a defined schema for initialization
- Maintains its own memory state
- Provides a rendering function that formats its state for the LLM

```ts
const myContext = context({
  // Unique identifier for this context type
  type: "my-context",

  // Schema defining the arguments needed to initialize this context
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
  }),

  // Function to generate a unique key for this context instance
  key({ id }) {
    return id;
  },

  // Initialize the context's memory state
  create(state) {
    return {
      items: [],
      currentItem: null,
    };
  },

  // Format the context for the LLM
  render({ memory }) {
    return `
      Current Items: ${memory.items.join(", ")}
      Active Item: ${memory.currentItem || "None"}
    `;
  },
});
```

### Actions

Actions are functions that your agent can call to interact with its environment
or modify its state. They're similar to event handlers in React:

```ts
action({
  name: "addItem",
  description: "Add a new item to the list",
  schema: z.object({
    item: z.string().describe("The item to add"),
  }),
  handler(call, ctx, agent) {
    // Access the context memory
    const contextMemory = ctx.agentMemory;

    // Update the state
    contextMemory.items.push(call.data.item);

    // Return a response
    return {
      message: `Added ${call.data.item} to the list`,
      items: contextMemory.items,
    };
  },
});
```

### Extensions

Extensions are pre-packaged bundles of inputs, outputs, and actions that add
specific capabilities to your agent. For example, the `cli` extension adds
terminal input/output capabilities.

## Creating an Agent

The `createDreams` function is the entry point for creating a Daydreams agent.
It brings together all the components:

```ts
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { cli } from "@daydreamsai/core/extensions";
import { groq } from "@daydreamsai/core/models";

const agent = createDreams({
  // The LLM to use
  model: groq("deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"),

  // Extensions to include
  extensions: [cli],

  // Your custom context
  context: myContext,

  // Custom actions
  actions: [
    // Your actions here
  ],
}).start();
```

## The React-like Mental Model

If you're familiar with React, you can think of Daydreams in similar terms:

- **Contexts** are like React components, managing state and rendering
- **Actions** are like event handlers, responding to inputs and updating state
- **Extensions** are like pre-built component libraries
- The agent itself is like a React application, orchestrating everything

This mental model makes it easy to reason about how your agent works and how to
structure complex behaviors.

## Bootstrapping a New Agent

The easiest way to get started with Daydreams is to use the CLI tool:

### Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g @daydreamsai/create-agent
```

### Create a new agent

```bash
npx @daydreamsai/create-agent dreaming-agent
```

This will scaffold a new agent project with all the necessary files and
dependencies.

### Navigate to your project

```bash
cd dreaming-agent
```

### Start your agent

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Complete Example

Here's a minimal example of a Daydreams agent:

```ts
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { cli } from "@daydreamsai/core/extensions";
import { groq } from "@daydreamsai/core/models";

const agent = createDreams({
  model: groq("deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"),
  extensions: [cli],
}).start();
```

This will run the agent in the terminal. Talk to it!
